## Base knowledge of variables
- The base form of decalation is the below.
  > const *variable* = *expression*;
- These are examples (*greeting* is a variable and "Hello" is an expression of string):
  ```js
  const greeting = "Hello";
  ```

## Indentifier
- There are rules about how to define a variable name.
- In the previous example, `greeting` is an identifier.
- As a identifier, `reserved words` are not allowed.
  - `if` and `const` are reserved words, so it is impossible to use these as an indentifier.

## Type Annotation
- After a variable
  ```js
  const greeting: string = "Hello";
  ```

## Using `let`
- To define variables, it is possible to use not only `const` but also `let`
  ```js
  let greeting = "Hello";
  ```
- The main difference of `let` and `const` is reassign.
  ```js
  let greeting = "Hello";

  // ⭕️
  greeting = "Hello World";
  ```

  ```js
  const greeting = "Hello";

  // ❌
  greeting = "Hello World";
  ```
- Also, `let` can define a variable without a value.
  ```js
  let greeting;
  greeting = "Hello";
  ```

## `const` vs `let`
- Recommend to avoid using `let`.
- Main reasons are
  - Almost all variables, statically 90%, does not need a reassigning.
  - When there are `let` definitions, the reades must care the values always.
